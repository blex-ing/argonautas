  <h1>Our History</h1>

<div class="parallax">
  <!-- <h1>Once upon a time there was a team of dreamers: Arantxa, Michael, Joan, Claudia and Tania. United by their passion for space exploration, they embarked on an unusual odyssey by signing up for a space hackathon without previously knowing each other.

    Arantxa and Joan, two restless spirits, shared their fascination with space and came together with a clear purpose. Tania, passionate about the cosmos, joined the team through NASA chat, injecting her energy and curiosity. Claudia and Michael, brilliant minds looking for exciting challenges, joined the group during the presentation on the first day of the hackathon, bringing their unique skills.
    
    Their mission was clear, but they needed a name to represent them. Thus "Argonauts" was born, inspired by the ancient legend of adventurers led by Jason in search of the Golden Fleece. Like the legendary heroes of that time, they believed that their individual abilities would combine in perfect synergy.
    
    Claudia, future biomedical engineering; Arantxa, an expert in robotics and software; Michael and Joan, masters in computer engineering and telecommunications; and Tania, a promising Industrial Organization engineer, formed an exceptional multidisciplinary team.
    
    With unique skills and unwavering commitment, the Argonauts embarked on their own space quest, ready to brave the stars and share the thrill of space exploration with the world. These five brave adventurers were ready to make history in the vast and mysterious universe.</h1> -->
