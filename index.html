        <h2>Our challenge is to create a virtual reality game called "Among the Stars" that allows players to explore space missions interactively. This implies three major challenges: </h2>

         <h2>Create a public website that explains our idea and makes our experience available for all.
          
          Design game logic to immerse players in space exploration.
          
          Use accurate data generated by GMAT software to turn it into a virtual reality experience.
          
          Our goal is to bring the emotion and knowledge of space to our audience. Are you ready to join us on this exciting intergalactic journey?</h2>

        <h2>Welcome to a unique experience in which you are the commander of your own space mission. Our game is like a "choose your adventure" in space, where every choice you make affects the outcome of your mission. Are you ready for the challenge?

          Difficulty Levels as Missions: We start with the legendary "Apollo 11 Mission", which represents the easy level. But that's just the beginning. As you progress through the game, you can choose more challenging missions, such as "Calypso", "Juno" or "Maven". And, in the near future, we will be adding even more missions for your enjoyment.
          
          From Launch to Success: At first, the mission starts from launch. But we are working on taking the experience one step further. We plan to add the complete stage of the mission, from obtaining the initial investment to the development of calculations to build rockets and satellites, the selection of a multidisciplinary team of physicists, engineers, mathematicians, astronauts... The team is key to success in the space.
          
          Making Critical Decisions: As you progress on your mission, you will make critical decisions every step of the way. What is the best route for your ship? What to do in case of emergency? Every choice has consequences, and if you make the wrong decision, we will provide you with a detailed explanation so you can learn about space missions while having fun.
          
          Reducing Environmental Impact: We are not only here to explore space, we also want to take care of our planet. At the end of each mission, we challenge you to think about how we could make our missions more efficient and environmentally friendly. Your ideas are important, and you can share your proposals with NASA and contribute to the future of space missions.
          
          Get ready to embark on an exciting space adventure, make crucial decisions and learn about space exploration while enjoying the unique experience we offer you in our game "Among the Stars"!</h2>

      <h2>However, we wanted to go beyond. We realized that a very important factor nowadays is the environmental aspect of everything is key. So after every mission we make a conclusion of what is the environmental impact the mission had and explaining alternatives that are available to prevent those consequences.</h2>
